# Vulnerability Assessment Lab with Greenbone Security Assistant (OpenVAS)

OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is an open-source vulnerability scanner used for comprehensive network security assessments. It identifies a wide range of weaknesses, including outdated software, missing patches, known CVEs, default or weak credentials, exposed services, and system misconfigurations. OpenVAS supports both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, making it a powerful tool for enterprise-grade vulnerability management, compliance testing, and attack surface reduction.
This lab demonstrates a complete vulnerability assessment workflow using Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA), part of the OpenVAS vulnerability scanning suite. The scan targets a local subnet, and the task configuration includes customized scan tuning for deeper results.

---

## Lab Objectives
- Configure OpenVAS (Greenbone Security Assistant) on Kali Linux.
- Add authenticated credentials for deeper scanning.
- Create and tune scan configurations.
- Scan a local subnet and analyze high-severity findings.

## Creating a Scan Target

### Target Configuration

## Scan Configuration Tuning

### Selecting Scan Templates

Multiple prebuilt scan templates are available; the Full and Fast template is cloned and customized to align with enterprise scanning needs and prioritize business-relevant vulnerabilities.

### Editing Scan Families

Specific vulnerability families like buffer overflows, CentOS checks, and denial-of-service were selected to focus the scan on issues that could lead to system compromise or service outages. This helped narrow the results to threats more relevant to a typical business or enterprise environment.

## Launching the Scan Task

### Task Setup

Task LAN_SCAN is configured to scan lan-subnet-86 using the customized scan configuration. The minimum QoD (Quality of Detection) was set to 70 to filter out low-confidence results and reduce false positives. Result overrides were applied to highlight or de-emphasize findings based on specific CVEs or detection rules, allowing for better prioritization of vulnerabilities. Alerts were also configured to trigger based on severity, supporting faster incident response.

### Scan Execution Parameters

The scan identified several high-severity vulnerabilities, including outdated versions of OpenSSL, PHP, jQuery, and Apache HTTP Server. These end-of-life and misconfigured services pose significant security risks and require immediate attention.

### Nmap Validation

![Screenshot 2025-06-01 081711](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52692e17-9f8b-41aa-8fe3-5a30a62b23b9)

Nmap confirms open ports found on host `10.0.0.19`, verifying GSA findings.
